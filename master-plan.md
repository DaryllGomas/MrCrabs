## 🎯 EAGLE EYE MACRO OVERVIEW (October 17, 2025)

### 🔴 STATE OF PLAY

- **Composite downgrades to WEAK (35.36/100):** Trend, breadth, and technical components all faded together while volatility surged.
- **Volatility shock:** SPY -2.7%, QQQ -3.5%, VIX spiked to 22 (+34%) and BTC 24h change -3.5%. Respect wider ranges and gap risk.
- **ETF flows still positive but slower:** Mid-week +$900M intake cooled to +$210M on Friday—supportive yet fragile.
- **Macro gauntlet ahead:** PPI (Tue), CPI (Wed), ECB minutes (Thu) form a three-day event cluster that will dictate risk appetite.
- **Fear & Greed at 64 (Greed):** Sentiment lags price; watch for capitulation if CPI disappoints.

### 📊 IMMEDIATE IMPLICATIONS

| Focus | Guidance | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Positioning | **Run lighter gross** | 45-55% equities / 15-20% crypto / balance cash & hedges until breadth thrust (>70% up-volume) confirms repair |
| Hedging | **Keep protection on** | Maintain VIX calls / QQQ or BTC put spreads through CPI, reassess after data |
| Liquidity | **Watch ETF flows daily** | Sustained net inflows are the key tell; first negative day would trigger deeper de-risk |
| Rotation | **Favor defensives** | Energy infrastructure, cash-flow tech, quality L2 / RWA names; avoid illiquid beta |
| Execution | **Pre-plan CPI scenarios** | Define bull/base/bear triggers (breadth thrust, VIX <19, ETF flows >$500M) before volatility hits |

### ⚠️ KEY RISKS TO TRACK

1. **Breadth deterioration:** NYSE and Nasdaq up-volume <40%; failed rallies likely until thrust occurs.
2. **Volatility follow-through:** If VIX holds >20 and BTC IV >50%, expect choppy sessions with larger tails.
3. **Macro surprises:** CPI print can rapidly reprice Fed expectations; pre-define max loss and exit triggers.
4. **ETF flow reversal:** Dip buyers lean on ETF demand; monitor for first net outflow day.
5. **Weekend liquidity:** Crypto books are thin; stage orders carefully until CME futures reopen Sunday.

### 📅 WEEKEND TASKS & SUNDAY PREP

1. **Run ETF flow audit** (Saturday 09:30 EST drop).
2. **Refresh CPI game-plans** (levels, catalysts, hedge adjustments).
3. **Update breadth dashboard** (advance/decline, up-volume, equal-weight indices).
4. **Rebuild watchlists** focusing on relative-strength names holding key supports.
5. **Reconcile risk matrix** with new volatility inputs; ensure position sizing cuts (<1R per idea).

### 📌 TACTICAL PLAYBOOK (NEXT 1-2 WEEKS)

- **Base case (50%) – Stabilize then grind:** ETF inflows stay positive, CPI in-line, breadth mends. Add back selectively after VIX <19 and breadth thrust.
- **Bear case (35%) – Further de-risk:** CPI hot or flows negative; SPX targets 6,450/6,320, BTC tests $113K then $108K. Stay defensive, add to hedges.
- **Bull case (15%) – Snap-back rally:** CPI favorable, flows surge >$600M, BTC reclaims $122K. Re-engage growth/alt risk with tight risk controls.

### ✅ ACTION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Confirm ETF flow print (Sat/Sun) and update trendline.
- [ ] Document CPI reaction triggers (entries, exits, max drawdown).
- [ ] Maintain hedge inventory (qty, strikes, expiry) and roll plan.
- [ ] Refresh communication plan (alerts, desk coverage for CPI).
- [ ] Keep discretionary adds on hold until breadth + volatility confirm improvement.

- ETF bid remains intact: spot BTC vehicles logged ~$900M inflows this week even as price slipped.
- Rotation narrative gaining traction: capital rotating from mega-cap tech into energy, defensive cyclicals, and selective alts.
- Macro catalyst cluster (PPI 10/14, CPI 10/15, ECB minutes 10/16) is the dominant near-term driver.
- Volatility spike signals respect for risk: desks cite the jump in VIX term structure as reason to lighten gross.
- Crypto sentiment still resilient: Fear & Greed at 64 (Greed) despite price pullback; crypto analysts stress buy-the-dip mentality but with tighter risk.

### Opportunities & Actions (Tactical Execution)
- Use weekend session to trim underperformers and recycle into relative-strength names showing accumulation (energy, quality alts).
- Maintain / add hedges (VIX calls, short QQQ futures) into CPI; plan to unwind only if breadth rebuilds after the print.
- Stage conditional orders for BTC between $112K-$115K and ETH near $3,850 with clear invalidation if ETF flows fade.
- Prepare CPI/PPI scenarios with trigger levels for risk-on re-engagement (breadth thrust, VIX back <19, trend reclaim).
- Monitor Japan CPI and China credit data for confirmation that global liquidity tailwind persists.

### Risks & Monitoring (Red Flags)
- Breadth deterioration: NYSE up-volume <40% on the sell-off; need thrust >70% to negate.
- Volatility expansion: VIX 22 and BTC IV 52% mean wider stops and potential intraday whipsaws.
- Macro gauntlet: CPI surprise can invalidate current theses rapidly; pre-position with clearly defined max loss.
- Sentiment divergence: social sentiment remains Greedy while price weakens—watch for capitulation if CPI disappoints.
- Liquidity pockets: weekend crypto trading depth is thin; avoid oversized orders until CME reopens.
